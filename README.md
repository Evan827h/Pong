A single player game of pong against a Computer opponent made with Unity.

Player is the left pong paddle.

There are 3 levels of dificulty for the oppnent player, If you can beat Hard hats off to you I've yet to beat it.

Computer Oponent was made using a vector plot algorythm I made to tell the right pong where to intercept the ball.

ball accelerates based off number of collisions.
