# Pong
A single player game of pong against a Computer opponent made with Unity, Scripts in C#.

Run the game under GameRun/Pong.exe

Player is the left pong paddle.
Use W/S to move up and down.

There are 3 levels of dificulty for the oppnent player, If you can beat Hard hats off to you I've yet to beat it.

Computer Oponent was made using a vector plot algorythm I made to tell the right pong where to intercept the ball.

The Ball accelerates based off number of collisions with player paddles.
